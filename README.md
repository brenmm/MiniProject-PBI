## Goals
Practice what I learned in the APIs and Web Scraping lessons. 

## Analysis
First, an open API was chosen, where only an api key was necessary to generate. Following the documentation, some calls were made and their successfully responses were obtained.
Lastly, a web with no requirements for the user-agent was studied. The HTML from the page was scraped in order to parse it and then extract the information.

## Conclusions
Here, with the two cases scenarios from APIs and Web scraping, the sentiment or emotion from a movie script and the respective review is analyzed.
The sentiment or emotions reflected in a summary corresponds or not from the emotions showed in the movie summary/transcription. Therefore, this relation will be influenced in the final ratings of the movie.
